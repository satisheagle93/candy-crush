# candy-crush
This is a mockup of the famous candy crush game made using pure JavaScript
The game needs a button and I am working on making it right now, this is just a visual mock up of the game
Steps to play:
1. You can make combinations of 3,4 and 5 in both row and column directions for 3,4,5 points respectively.
2. The game gets filled up with random objects as soon as the top row gets empty.
